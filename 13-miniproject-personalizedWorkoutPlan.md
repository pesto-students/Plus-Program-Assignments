## Mini Project Task: Personalized Workout Plan using OpenAI API

### Time Estimate: 4 hours

### Guidelines:

1.  Project Overview:
    
    *   Build a web application using ReactJS that generates a personalized workout plan for users.
    *   Utilize the OpenAI API to generate workout recommendations based on user preferences and goals.
2.  Setup:
    
    *   Create a new ReactJS project using your preferred setup (e.g., Create React App).
    *   Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Axios for API requests, any UI libraries of your choice).
3.  User Interface:
    *   Design a user-friendly interface for capturing user preferences and goals.
    *   Include input fields for age, gender, fitness level, target muscle groups, and desired workout duration.
    *   Provide options for the user to select specific exercises or choose a general workout plan.
4.  OpenAI API Integration:
    *   Obtain an API key for the OpenAI API (GPT-3).
    *   Set up API integration by making requests to the OpenAI API endpoint using Axios or a similar library.
    *   Pass user preferences and goals as inputs to the API for generating personalized workout recommendations.
5.  API Response Handling:
    *   Parse and handle the response received from the OpenAI API.
    *   Extract the generated workout plan and relevant details from the response.
6.  Displaying Workout Plan:
    *   Render the generated workout plan on the user interface.
    *   Display exercise names, sets, repetitions, and any additional instructions.
    *   Use appropriate styling and formatting to improve readability.
7.  Additional Features (optional):
    *   Implement a feature to save and retrieve previously generated workout plans.
    *   Include options for users to customize generated plans by adding or removing exercises.
    *   Add a progress tracker to record completed workouts and track user's fitness journey.
8.  Testing and Error Handling:
    *   Perform testing and handle potential errors or exceptions.
    *   Ensure the application handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., empty responses, network errors).
9.  Documentation and Deployment:
    *   Document the project, including setup instructions and any additional details.
    *   Deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

Best coding practices & guidelines should be followed from here: 

Redux & Style Guidelines:
1.Add Redux into the application.
2.Wire Redux with the React App using built in methods.
3.The Action, Dispatchers and Reducer files should have been created.
4.Bonus for adding styles to the application.
5.The Action - Dispatch - Reducer - Store flow should work as expected.

Note: Keep in mind that the OpenAI API usage and integration may require additional time for setup and understanding the API documentation. 

Note: Ensure your code is well-structured, properly commented, and follows best practices for code quality and readability, including Redux-specific guidelines.
