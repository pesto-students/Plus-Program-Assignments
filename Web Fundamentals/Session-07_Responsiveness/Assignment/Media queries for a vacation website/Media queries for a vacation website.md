700px breakpoint  

**Hints: (Refer only if required)** 

Add a media query that applies when the viewport's width is at least 700px. Use the nav li selector to set display: inline; so the three navigation links now appear next to each other. Also use the header > h1 selector to make the h1 font size 3rem instead of 2rem.

800px breakpoint  

**Hints: (Refer only if required)** 

Add a media query that applies when the viewport's width is at least 800px:

- Use the .vacation-container img selector to change the image width to 50vw so vacation images occupy half the viewport's width.
- Use the .vacation-container selector to make the vacation descriptions appear to the right of the vacation images instead of underneath.
- Use the .vacation-container > div selector to add a 20px margin between the vacation descriptions and images.

The screenshot below shows how the vacation image and text now appear next to each other when the viewport is at least 800px wide.
